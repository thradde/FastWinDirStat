		<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
		<h3>Does the treemap relate to the allocation of hard disk sectors?</h3>
		<p>No. The treemap view has nothing to do with hard disk sectors. Generally big 
			files are scattered on the hard disk. The treemap on the other hand shows each 
			file as <i>one</i> rectangle.
		</p>
		<h3>Does WinDirStat start threads for the read jobs?</h3>
		<p>No. WinDirStat is - apart from the about box, which runs in an own thread,
		    and apart from the drive querying in the drive selection dialog - 
			single-threaded. All work is done in OnIdle().
		</p>
		<h3>What does the item &lt;Files&gt; mean?</h3>
		<p>See <A href="legend.htm">Legend</A>.
		</p>
		<h3>What does the &gt; symbol in front of the column captions mean?</h3>
		<p>The &gt; and &lt; symbols in the column headers indicate the current <A href="sorting.htm">
				sorting</A>.
		</p>
		<h3>On my XP WinDirStat shows more than a GB &lt;Unknown&gt;, what's wrong?</h3>
		<p>Nothing. XP quite often creates rather big 'System restore points' under 
			C:\System Volume Information, but denies access to it.
		</p>
		<h3>What is the file wdsr0407.dll for?</h3>
		<p>This file contains the German translation of WinDirStat. 0407 is the language 
			identifier for "German - Germany". If this file is absent, then WinDirStat is 
			available in the (built-in) language English only.
		</p>
		<h3>The size information in KB and MB seems to be a bit too small.</h3>
		<p>WinDirStat sticks to the computing convention, that "kilo" doesn't stand for 
			1000 but for 1024. So we have:<br>
			1 KB = 1024 Bytes<br>
			1 MB = 1024 KB = 1,048,576 Bytes<br>
			1 GB = 1024 MB = 1,048,576 KB = 1,073,741,824 Bytes.
