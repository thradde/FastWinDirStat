		<h2>Configuration</h2>
		<h3>General</h3>
		<p><u>Cross file system boundaries (only NT and higher)</u>. Under NTFS volumes can 
			be mounted in directories. By default WinDirStat stops reading at these mount 
			points, i.e. it shows only the usage of <i>one</i> file system. Here you can 
			change this behavior. (No mount points are recognized on UNC drives.)
		</p>
		<p><u>Follow Junction Points (except Volume Mount Points) (only NT and higher)</u>.
			Under NTFS target folders can be grafted onto another folder by using junction points.
			(You need a third-party tool, e.g. awxlink, downloadable from 
			<a href="http://www.arniworld.de/" target="_blank">http://www.arniworld.de/</a>, to create junction points.)
			By default WinDirStat stops reading at these junction points. Here you can
			change this behavior.
		</p>
		<p><u>List Style</u>. These options, grid and stripes, apply to all lists in WinDirStat.
		</p>
		<p><u>Language</u>. In addition to the built-in language English, this combo box 
			offers those languages, for which a correspondig wdsrxxxx.dll exists. The 
			setting takes effect next time when WinDirStat is started.</p>
		<h3>Directory List</h3>
		<p>Two options which control what the columns 'Subtree Percentage' and 'Percentage'
		display during the scan. Colors for the subtree percentage presentation.
		</p>
		<h3>Treemap</h3>
		<p>Squarification style, parameters for the cushion shading, grid lines, color of the 
			selection rectangle.
		</p>
		<h3>Cleanups</h3>
		<p>Here you can configure the <a href="userdefinedcleanups.htm">User Defined Cleanups</a>.
		</p>
		<h3>Report</h3>
		<p>Administrators can customize the e-mail report feature here.</p>
