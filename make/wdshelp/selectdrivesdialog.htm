		<h2>Select Drives Dialog</h2>
		<p>Here you can decide which drives to include in the statistics.
		</p>
		<p>You can select one or more drives from the list or choose a directory.
		</p>
		<p>The list shows all present drives (hard disks, inserted floppy disks or CDs, and 
			network drives).</p>
		<h3>Columns</h3>
		<p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>Name</u>. Name and drive letter of the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Total</u>. Capacity of the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Free</u>. Free space on the drive.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Used/Total</u> Percentage of used space, related to the capacity.</li>
				<li>
					<u>Used/Total</u> The same information in percent.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h3>Operation</h3>
		<p>The dialog box has three "radio buttons".
			<ul>
				<li>
					<u>All local drives</u>. This is the default. Scans all local drives, that is 
					all drives, which are not network drives. Drives created with SUBST are also 
					excluded (NT and higher only).
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>Individual drives</u>. Here you can explicitly select a set of drives.
				</li>
				<li>
					<u>A folder</u>. Here you can select a folder or an UNC path.
				</li>
			</ul>
			Click on OK to begin the scan.
		</p>
		<p>The selection is persistent, i.e. when you open the dialog the next time, the 
			default setting will be that which you made the last time.</p>
