		<h2>Sorting</h2>
		<p>All lists in WinDirStat can be sorted at will. The current sorting is
		indicated by the symbols &lt; and &gt; in the column headings.
		&lt; means ascending sort, &gt; means descending sort.
		</p>
		<p>You can set the desired sorting by a mouse click on a column heading.
		</p>
		<p>Actually two columns are drawn on the sorting. First that one, on which
		you clicked last, and second - if the elements are equal regarding this column -
		that, which sorted before.
		</p>
		<p>Note that the sorting of the directory list of course respects the
		tree structure: sorting occurs only within one level.
		</p>
		<p></p>
		<h3>Annotation</h3>
		<p>The column widths and column order can be adjusted via drag 'n drop. 
		The widths and column order are persistent; that is, at program
		start they are automatically restored as you have set them last.
