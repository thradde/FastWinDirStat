		<h2>Treemap</h2>
		<p>The treemap shows the whole contents of the <a href="whatisatree.htm">directory tree</a>
			straight away.
		</p>
		<p>It represents each file as a colored rectangle, the area of which is 
			proportional to the file's size.
		</p>
		The rectangles are arranged in such a way, that directories again make up 
		rectangles, which contain all their files and subdirectories. So their area is 
		proportional to the size of the subtrees. </p>
		<p>The color of a rectangle indicates the type of the file, as shown in the 
			extension list.
		</p>
		<p>The cushion shading additionally brings out the directory structure.</p>
		<h3>Operation</h3>
		<p>You effortlessly see the big rectangles, that is the big files, even if they are 
			hidden deeply in subdirectories in the directory tree. Click on them: the 
			directory list opens the path to the file, and you can read its location and 
			attributes, and - if you like - apply a cleanup action on it, e.g. delete the 
			file.
		</p>
		<p>Navigate in the directory list: the respective selection is highlighted with a 
			colored frame. In this way gain an impression of the proportions: How big, for 
			example, is C:\windows compared with C:\program files?
		</p>
		<p>The context menu options "Select Parent" and "Re-select Child" are also useful 
			for the navigation.
		</p>
		<p>Zoom. The option "Zoom in" enlarges the treemap, so that a subtree is 
			displayed full size. As it were you make a step towards the selected item. 
			The directory list show the root of this subtree with a blue frame. 
			By "Zoom out" you step back, and the parent element is shown again.
