		<h2>What is a Directory Tree?</h2>
		<p>On most computer operating systems, so on Microsoft Windows, the data on the 
			hard disk are organized hierarchically.
		</p>
		<p>On the one hand there are the <i>files</i> which have a certain size and contain 
			the effective data. Each file has a name. Under Microsoft Windows the "filename 
			extension" informs about the type of the file. The extension ".exe", for 
			instance, indicates that it's a program file. The extension ".doc" indicates a 
			WinWord document, ".jpg" is a photo, and so on. But ridiculously the Microsoft 
			Windows Explorer hides these filename extensions by default. You can change 
			this behaviour in the options menu of the Windows Explorer.
		</p>
		<p>On the other hand there are <i>directories</i>. The Windows Explorer and 
			WinDirStat, too, symbolize directories as yellow folders. Directories also 
			have a name, but normally without a filename extension. Directories only serve 
			to contain files and other directories ("sub-directories"). Due to the fact 
			that directories can contain subdirectories, and those again can contain 
			subdirectories, the result is a hierarchical structure on the disk.
		</p>
		<p>

			Instead of "hierarchical structure" we simply say <i>tree structure</i>. Since 
			a tree is built hierarchical as well: The trunk branches out into branches, the 
			branches into sub-branches, twigs and finally into the leaves. In a file system 
			the so called root directory is the trunk, the directories 
			are the branches and the files are the leaves.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's why we call the file system of a computer simply a "directory tree".
		</p>
		<p><br clear="all" />
			Unlike most real trees, on a disk the trunk and the branches already have 
			leaves. And, unlike most real trees, too: the <u>files</u> are the voluminous 
			entities (the size of which is measured by megabytes or gigabytes), whereas the 
			actual directories are neglectibly small. By the way, we imagine abstract trees 
			as turned round: the root at the top, the leaves at the bottom.
		</p>
		<p>If you saw a branch off a tree and stick it into the earth, then it becomes 
			itself a little tree (well, at least it looks like one): Every branch is, 
			together with its sub-branches and leaves, itself a tree, a <i>subtree</i>.
		</p>
		<p>The family tree metaphor is often used as well: The subdirectories and files of 
			a directory are called its <i>children</i>. And a directory containing a 
			subdirectory or file is called their <i>parent</i>. The root directory is 
			earliest ancestor of all items in the directory tree.
		</p>
		<p>A <i>path</i> like "C:\documents\letters\draft\loveletter.doc" indicates that on 
			the hard disk C:, in the root directory "C:\" there is a directory "documents", 
			under it the subdirectory "letters", under it a subdirectory "draft" and in 
			there a file "loveletter.doc". So the path is a precise representation of the 
			way from the root to the leaf.
