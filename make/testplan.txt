Windirstat - Test Plan
======================

Quick Overall Test
------------------
--> There are 11 files in the binary distribution of WinDirStat:
    setup.exe, 
    shfolder.dll, 
    wdsh0407.chm, 
    wdsh0415.chm,
    wdsr0407.dll,
    wdsr040c.dll,
    wdsr040e.dll,
    wdsr0415.dll,
    wdsr0419.dll, 
    windirstat.chm, 
    windirstat.exe.
--> The version infos of the executables show the correct version number.

Delete C:\program files\windirstat
Delete all shortcuts to windirstat
Delete HKCU\Software\seifert\windirstat

Start setup.exe
--> On German systems, the language is German,
	On French systems, the language is French,
	On Polish systems, the language is Polish,
    On other systems, the language is English.
Using the default settings, proceed through the installation
--> WinDirStat starts up
    On German systems, in German,
    On French systems, in French,
    On Polish systems, in Polish,
    On Russian systems, in Russian,
    On other systems, in English.
    The Select Drives Dialog comes up with the default "All local drives".
Press OK.
--> All local drives are scanned, with pacman animation.
    Then the treemap and extension list are shown.
Quit WinDirStat.
--> In C:\program files\windirstat there are 8 files.
--> There is a shortcut to windirstat.exe on the desktop (all users).
--> There is a shortcut to windirstat.exe in the Start menu (all users on NT, local user on W9x).
--> There is a shortcut to windirstat.exe in the SendTo-Folder.
--> There is a registry key in HKCU\Software\Seifert\windirstat.

Critical Features
-----------------
Select the English Language and restart WinDirStat
(the English version should be tested best).

Drag+Drop a folder onto the desktop shortcut
--> WinDirStat comes up with this folder as root.
Drag+Drop an empty folder onto the desktop shortcut
--> WinDirStat comes up with a black treemap.
Insert an empty diskette into drive A:
Select this drive as root
--> WinDirStat comes up with a black treemap.
Select some big drives
During the scan quit WinDirStat
--> WinDirStat quits silently.

Copy some big directories to C:\temp (for deletion).
For the following "during the scan" tests it is is good idea,
to activate the "cross file system boundaries" option and
mount e.g. C: to D:\mount\c and D: to C:\mount\d. Because
of the circularity the scan will then last forever (well
there seems to be some system limit of recursion depth, 
but on my machine it virtually lasts forever).

Select some big drives
During the scan refresh some items
--> WinDirStat refreshs the items.
During the scan expand and collapse folders
During the scan open the about box
--> The scan continues even with the about box open.
During the scan delete a file under c:\temp (to the recycle bin)
--> The extra warning comes up.
Say No
--> Nothing happens.
Delete the file under C:\temp again
--> The extra warning comes up again.
Say Yes
--> The Shell warning comes up. This dialog is modal to WinDirStat.
Say No
--> Nothing happens (the item is refeshed).
Delete the file under C:\temp again
--> The extra warning comes up again
Say "Don't show this warning again"
Say No.
--> Nothing happens.
Delete the file under C:\temp again
--> The extra waring comes up again
Say "Don't show this warning again"
Say Yes.
--> The Shell warning comes up. This dialog is modal to WinDirStat.
Say Yes.
--> The file is deleted, the view is refreshed.
Delete another file under C:\temp.
--> The Shell warning comes up. This dialog is modal to WinDirStat.
Say No.

--> The menu Clean Up shows Empty Recycle Bin with at least 1 item.
--> This information corresponds to the properties of the recycle bin.
During the scan do Clean Up->Empty Recycle Bin
--> A Shell warning comes up. This dialog is modal to WinDirStat.
Say No
--> Nothing happens
During the scan do Clean Up->Empty Recycle Bin again
--> A Shell warning comes up.  This dialog is modal to WinDirStat.
Say Yes
--> Your recycle bin is emptied, the recycler folders are refreshed,
During the scan delete a big folder in C:\temp.
Confirm the Shell warning with Yes.
--> The deletion progress dialog is modal to WinDirStat.

Deactivate the "cross file system boundaries" option.
--> The 2 mount points are refreshed and empty. The scan completes.

When the scan is complete, select a file deep in the tree.
Repeatedly "select parent" and "re-select child" by keyboard, context menu and main menu.
Repeatedly "select parent". Then select a different item.
--> "re-select child" is disabled.
Repeatedly "zoom in" and "zoom out" by keyboard, context menu and main menu.
Zoom in some levels.
Select an item outside of the zoom root.
--> The zoom is place to the common ancestor of the item and the pervious zoom root.

Delete folder in C:\temp.
--> The item is refreshed. The treemap is dimmed and then rebuilt.

Resize the main window.
--> The treemap is dimmed and then rebuilt.

F9
--> Shows/hides the treemap

F8
--> Shows/hides the extension list

F6
--> Shows/hides <free space>
--> The free space correspondes to the properties of the drive.

F7
--> Shows/hides <unknown>

For NT and W9x DO
	For each item type (My Computer, drive, folder, file, <Files>, <Freespace>, <Unknown>) DO
		For each access method (Main menu, context menu, toolbar, shortcut)
			Open Item
			Copy Path
			Explorer here
			Command prompt here
			Refresh selected
			Delete to recycle bin
			Delete (no way to undelete)
			Properties
			Send email to Owner
			--> The action is either disabled or works as expected.
		NEXT access method
	NEXT item type
NEXT platform
